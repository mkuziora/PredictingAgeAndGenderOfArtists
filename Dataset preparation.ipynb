    "# Dataset preparation\n",
    "After collecting a lot of data from different sources it must have been merged to create one dataset, useful for machine learning tasks. It has been done in few iterations, depending on the available type of information. As pointed out before some artists had both Musicbrainz and Spotify IDs, so it was very easy to match those entries from two databases. For the rest of them more complicated approach needed to be applied: first, similarity between names was computed and sets of the artists with most similar names were created. In each of those sets (usually 5-10 artists) similarities between albums' names were computed and the artist entries with the biggest number of albums with similarities above some predefined threshold were connected to each other.
