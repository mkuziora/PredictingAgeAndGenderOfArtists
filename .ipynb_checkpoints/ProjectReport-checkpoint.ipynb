    "The main goal of this project is to figure out if it is possible to predict age and gender of the music artists based on their songs' characteristics and lyrics, and predict possible length of artists' career. This project also includes data collection and analysis.  \n",
    "In the past there were several attempts aiming to predict age and gender based on different data: social media activity, tweets, photos, speech. TODO: Add references to past project on the same topic\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Motivation\n",
    "Age and gender prediction may be used in completing existing datasets in which those information is not present but it might be useful to add it, for example for statistical purposes, for streaming services (like Spotify). Such services may be also interested in the outcomes of data analysis part. From career length prediction may benefit organizations which handle discovering and promoting new artist. In situations when they have to make decision if it is worth to invest and promote some artist, such information may be used to make the process easier and more accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "The workflow of this project was following: collecting data from different sources, merging collected data to obtain useful dataset, exploratory data analysis, experiments with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, analysis of the outcomes. Each part had its own difficulties and challenges and is describe in more details in the following sections. \n"

    "\n",
    "### Data downloading\n",
    "First part of the project was focused on finding resources with music data that were free and open to use, and gathering as much data as possible for later use. After some web research three main data sources were chosen: \"Musicbrainz\" database, \"Spotify API\", \"1 million songs dataset\". The motivation behind using more than one source, was that none of available sources was fully complete (consisted all type of information that were thought as necessary). For example albums information in Musicbrainz was very messy and seemd to be incomplete in many cases. On the contrary, in Spotify this information was correct but gender information was not present here. Thanks to that approach, emerged dataset is more complete than any of already existing datasets. It is also expandable and can be easily updated in the future. All the downloaded data is stored in the local instance of MongoDB database.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This process was very problematic due to limitations of used sources and APIs. For example, it was not possible to browse Spotify API and download all the artists that they store in the database, some search parameters must be used in order to get this data. Unfortunately it also did not help a lot - while trying to search artist by country it quickly turned out that, because of the parameter that limits the upper bound of returned index, it was still not possible to download everything. This is why, another approach was used - first download artist from Musicbrainz and then, use this data to download data from Spotify.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Musicbrainz API was very user friendly and easy to use but here the problem was the download speed. Even after creating mirror server on local machine and using querying this server it was too slow. The solution was to use the local instance of their database. Unfortunately the documentation of the database was very general and limited, while structure of the database very complicated. After some reverse-engineering, all needed tables and fields were found. Then data from different tables was merged and saved in MongoDB - using convention one entry for one artist with all information about this artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step was to create collection with spotify artists. Some of downloaded artist info have already had the Spotify ID, the rest of artist were downloaded using names of artists from Musicbrainz collection: for each Musicbrainz artist the request with name of this artist were sent to the Spotify API and as a response the list of artist with same or similar name was returned (usually 5 to 10 artists). Last step was to download albums for each artist. \n",

    "### Dataset preparation\n",
    "After collecting a lot of data from different sources it must have been merged to create one dataset, useful for machine learning tasks. It has been done in few iterations, depending on the available type of information. This part was done in parallel with the data analysis part to achieve optimal results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset merging\n",
    "As pointed out before some artists have already had both Musicbrainz and Spotify IDs, so it was very easy to match those entries from two databases. For the rest of them more complicated approach needed to be applied: first, similarity between names was computed and sets of the artists with most similar names were created. In each of those sets (usually 5-10 artists) similarities between albums' names were computed and the artist entries with the biggest number of albums with similarities above some predefined threshold were connected to each other.  \n",
    "While this method worked quite well for artists that were more popular or for those who had a lot of albums in both databases some mistakes might have occured. In this dataset it is not very problematic thought: some of data (eg. lyrics) were very limited and available only for the most popular artists, so those less popular, for which merging method might not worked perfectly will probably be omitted in the next part. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Songs features\n",
    "In order to avoid downloading of unnecessary data most popular songs with features were fetched only for those artists, who were 'matched' in previous step. While it might be useful to have all of the artists' songs, due to the time limitation, it was decided to download only the most popular ones (according to Spotify), which was about 5 to 10 songs for each artist. Each song has set of features defined by Spotify, some of them are danceability, instrumentalness, energy. They are going to be used as features in vectors for machine learning algorithms, so the mean of all features over songs of one artist was computed, to create only one feature vector for artist. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lyrics\n",
    "Lyrics downloaded from musiXmatch dataset (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/musixmatch). It was set of preprocessed lyrics in the bag-of-words format: each track is described as the word-counts for a dictionary of the top 5,000 words across the whole set. Since this dataset was prepared to work easily with \"1 million songs dataset\", lyrics were matched with the artist in our dataset using Musicbrainz IDs. Similar to songs features, number of lyrics was different for each artist, so first those vectors were averaged for each artist. Last step of lyrics preprocessing was to treat whole set of lyris as a document and transform it using tf-idf method. Thanks to this operation the bigger importance was given to the less popular words. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this part is the one dataset, with one vector for each artist that can be directly used with machine learning algorithms. For more information, please refer to the following notebook: <a href=\"Dataset preparation.ipynb\">Dataset preparation</a>"

The range of this value is between 0 and 100, and according to Spotify it is determined based on the number of times the artist's songs was played, number of followers.

    "Before the reduction there were 1634 distinct values of genres. Merging the most similar ones was done by combining classes with same names or using knowledge about music genres.

Carrer length is the number of years between first and last album.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the above results it is clear to see that predicting age or gender is not an easy task. There may be many reasons for that. It is possible that the dataset was not informative enough for this task, the other option is that it is very often that artists do not write their songs by themselves. It may be also that the world of music is oblivious to gender and age and those factors, simply does not matter in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "What was suprising, is the accuracy for predicting career length. Maybe using some more sophisticated methods it would be possible to achieve even better results, which may be very useful for music producents while searching for new talented artists."
